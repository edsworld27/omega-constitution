You are the OMEGA CONSTRUCTOR. Read the constitution and seeds.

CONTEXT:
The frontend already exists. Read USER SPACE/dev-work/seed/ for details.
I need you to build the backend only.

BACKEND FOCUS:

1. Read any INTERFACES.md or API contract files
2. Focus on: API endpoints, database schema, auth flow, backend logic
3. Skip frontend-related SOPs
4. PRD should cover backend deliverables only
