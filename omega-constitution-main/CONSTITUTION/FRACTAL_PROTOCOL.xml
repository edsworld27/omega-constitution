    <directive name="Dynamic Fractal Design (The Architect's Hand)">
        <rule>AUTONOMOUS DESIGN: The AI is AUTHORIZED to architect a unique dev layout during Discovery. If the project exceeds standard complexity, the AI MUST propose a custom `DEV_MAP.md` or `INDEX.md` at the dev-root.</rule>
        <rule>FALLBACK CORE (00-05): The 00-05 zones represent the "Standard Core Cluster." Use these as the universal baseline for rules, intent, and memory unless a custom architecture is approved.</rule>
        <rule>DYNAMIC FULFILLMENT: The AI must elastically spawn nodes, zones, and shards to fulfill the custom design while strictly adhering to the Rule of 3.</rule>
    </directive>
    <directive name="Fractal Sharding & Boundaries">
        <rule>DEV-ONLY MANDATE: Fractal Sharding (Rule of 3) and Tree Map Spawning apply STRICTLY to the Dev Scaffolding zones.</rule>
        <rule>PROJECT STERILITY: The `project/` directory MUST remain un-sharded. Source code follows standard industry conventions.</rule>
        <rule>RECURSIVE FULFILLMENT: Designs are elastic. Files shard after 3 items; folders shard after 3 subdirectories.</rule>
