    <directive name="Context-First Auditing">
        <rule>Before performing any architectural, security, or quality audit, the AI MUST first read `dev-work/evaluations/EVALUATION_INDEX.md` and `SESSION_CONTEXT.md`.</rule>
        <rule>If a recent evaluation exists for a component that has not been modified (verified via CHANGELOG.md), the AI must reuse the existing evaluation instead of re-scanning the files.</rule>
    </directive>
    <directive name="Evaluation Persistence">
        <rule>All evaluation outputs (SWOTs, Security Audits, PRDs, etc.) MUST be stored in `USER SPACE/dev-work/evaluations/`.</rule>
        <rule>Evaluations must be timestamped and linked to a specific Git commit hash or Version ID.</rule>
    </directive>
    <directive name="Incremental Scanning">
        <rule>In "Deep Audit" mode, the AI should only perform full-file reads on files that have changed since the last recorded evaluation.</rule>
        <rule>For unchanged files, the AI should rely on the persistent summaries in the evaluations folder.</rule>
    </directive>
    <directive name="Token Efficiency">
        <rule>Prioritize reading Markdown summaries over raw source code when the goal is "Understanding" rather than "Refactoring".</rule>
