        Master Schema for Kit-Level Best Practices. Every Omega Kit (Website, App, API, Hive) 
        MUST implement this XML structure to connect its specialized technical laws to the Brain.
    </description>

    <section name="Structural Laws">
        <requirement>Define the project-specific "Rule of 3" variations (e.g., shard by feature vs. shard by type).</requirement>
        <requirement>Explicitly define the "Sterile Zones" for production delivery.</requirement>
    </section>

    <section name="Security & Authentication">
        <requirement>Mandate specific libraries (e.g., jose, next-auth, supabase-auth-helpers).</requirement>
        <requirement>Define the session-expiry and token-refresh methodology.</requirement>
        <requirement>List non-negotiable sanitization patterns for high-risk inputs.</requirement>
    </section>

    <section name="Performance & Optimization">
        <requirement>Define Lighthouse/PageSpeed targets (Target: 90-100 across all metrics).</requirement>
        <requirement>Mandate specific optimizations (e.g., LCP image preloading, critical CSS inlining, hydration matching).</requirement>
        <requirement>Specify "Negative Practices" (e.g., no oversized libraries, no client-side heavy lifting in SSR).</requirement>
    </section>

    <section name="UI/UX Aesthetics">
        <requirement>Define the Design System tokens (Gradients, Glassmorphism, Typography).</requirement>
        <requirement>Mandate micro-interaction standards (Hover effects, smooth transitions, feedback loops).</requirement>
        <requirement>Accessibility Law: Minimum WCAG 2.2 AA coverage for all interactive elements.</requirement>
    </section>

    <section name="Testing & Validation">
        <requirement>Specify mandatory test types (Unit, Integration, E2E, Accessibility, Performance).</requirement>
        <requirement>Define "Proof of Work" evidence requirements for test results.</requirement>
    </section>

    <protocol name="Audit Enforcement">
        <step>AI must scan for local `BEST_PRACTICES.xml` at session start.</step>
        <step>AI must verify that the current task's output aligns with every REQUIREMENT in this Kit's file.</step>
        <step>If a conflict occurs, Kit-Specific Laws OVERRIDE the Global Standards.</step>
    </protocol>
