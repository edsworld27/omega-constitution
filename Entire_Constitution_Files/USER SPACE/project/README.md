# 📦 Project

**This is your clean, shareable project folder.**

When you're done building, this folder contains everything the recipient needs.

## Structure

```
project/
├── src/              ← Source code
├── tests/            ← Test files
├── public/           ← Static assets
├── docs/             ← User-facing docs (optional)
└── README.md         ← This file (replace with your project README)
```

---

## Handoff

To share your project:

1. Replace this README with your project's actual README
2. Zip or push this folder
3. Send to recipient

**No framework files here.** Just clean, deployable code.

---

## What's NOT Here

The following stay in `../dev-work/`:
- Requirement seeds
- Session context
- Progress tracking
- AI working memory
- Phase planning

The recipient doesn't need to see those.
