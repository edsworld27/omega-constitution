**This folder contains all Omega framework files used during development.**

You don't share this folder — it's your development workspace.

## What's Here

```
dev-work/
├── seed/                 ← Project requirements (PROJECT.md, BRAND.md, etc.)
├── phases/               ← Phase planning
├── plug-and-play/        ← Dropped assets (wireframes, existing code)
├── docs/                 ← Generated docs (PRD, specs)

```

## Workflow

1. **Discovery** → Fill seed files, AI asks questions
2. **Planning** → AI generates PRD, specs in docs/
3. **Building** → Code goes in `../project/`
4. **Handoff** → Share `../project/` folder only

*This folder is for development. The clean project is in `../project/`.*
