## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

1. **Update STATUS** as you move through phases
2. **Check off PRE-PRODUCTION** tasks as you complete them
3. **Add rows to PRODUCTION** for each feature you're building
4. **Add rows to TESTING** for each test type
5. **Log DECISIONS** so future sessions know why you did things
6. **IDEAS INBOX** captures scope creep — don't build, just log
