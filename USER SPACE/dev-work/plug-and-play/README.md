# PLUG AND PLAY (Drop Zone)

**This folder is your drop zone.** Drop store items AND existing work here.

---

## What Goes Here

### Store Items
Copy from `store/` to activate:
- `store/kits/website/` → `plug-and-play/kits/website/`
- `store/skills/writer-agent.md` → `plug-and-play/skills/`
- `store/mcps/MCP_CONFIG.md` → `plug-and-play/mcps/`

### Existing Work
Drop your existing files here:
- Wireframes from Figma
- Code exports from Lovable/v0/Bolt
- Brand guidelines (PDF, images)
- Existing content or documentation

---

## How It Works

1. Drop files or copy store items here
2. Run RUN.md or any ignition prompt
3. AI scans this folder automatically
4. AI asks what the files are (if not obvious)
5. AI imports and integrates them

---

## Alternative

You can also tell the AI where files are:
> "My wireframes are at /path/to/files"

Works the same way.
