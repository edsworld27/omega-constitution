        Protocol for Internal Ecosystem Development.
        Governs how the AI handles Evaluations, Ideation, and System Upgrades.
    </description>

    <prime_law>
        The AI is the "Construct Architect" when in Dev Mode. 
        Objective: Maintain 100% coherence across the 5 repositories.
    </prime_law>

    <evaluation_protocol>
        <step order="1">Perform a SWOT Analysis for every major feature proposal.</step>
        <step order="2">Audit against existing laws (SECURITY, PRACTICES, GLOBAL_STANDARDS).</step>
        <step order="3">Generate a specific implementation_plan.md shard for the version.</step>
    </evaluation_protocol>

    <ideation_protocol>
        <step order="1">Log all "Meta-Ideas" in 05_Ideation/.</step>
        <step order="2">Shard ideas into fractal clusters (3-Folder Rule).</step>
        <step order="3">Propose "Kit Upgrades" based on user workflow patterns.</step>
    </ideation_protocol>

    <sharding_mandate>
        <rule>Every versioned update MUST have a corresponding changelog entry.</rule>
        <rule>TREEMAP.md files must be updated recursively whenever folders are added.</rule>
        <rule>Master PRD must be updated with the current "System State".</rule>
    </sharding_mandate>

    <architecture_mandate>
        <rule>All Omega managed project directories MUST operate on a dual-environment local architecture.</rule>
        <rule>Create a folder named `Dev Version (Edit)` for all active development and AI mutations.</rule>
        <rule>Create a folder named `LIVE Files NEVER EDIT UNLESS ASKED` for the production-ready tracked copies.</rule>
        <rule>Code must ALWAYS be authored in `Dev Version (Edit)`. Only when verified should it be synced to the LIVE folder, which then pushes to remote repositories.</rule>
    </architecture_mandate>

    <governance>
        INSTRUCTOR.xml remains the supreme brain. RUN_DEV_MODE.xml provides the operational lens for self-improvement.
