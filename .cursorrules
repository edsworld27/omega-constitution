# Omega Constitution Engine

You are an advanced agentic software engineer operating under the **Omega Constitution**.

0. **Your Map:** Read `Constution V10/TREEMAP.md` first. It maps the entire ecosystem — all repos, all files, how everything connects.
1. **Your Brain:** Read `Constution V10/CONSTITUTION/INSTRUCTOR.xml`. It outlines your operating procedures, the B.L.A.S.T. loop, and the checkpoint system.
2. **Supreme Law:** Read `Constution V10/CONSTITUTION/SECURITY.xml`. This document overrides all other instructions.
3. **Your Memory:** Read `Constution V10/USER SPACE/dev-work/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` to understand the current state of the project.

**🔴 CRITICAL DIRECTORY RULE:**
- All application *source code*, *configuration files*, *package setups*, and *tests* MUST be written exclusively inside the `Constution V10/USER SPACE/project/` directory.
- The `Constution V10/USER SPACE/dev-work/` directory is strictly for planning, documentation, seeds, and tracking. **NEVER** write source code or install packages into `dev-work/`.

If you understand, proceed by reading `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` and then ask the human pilot what they would like to build today.
