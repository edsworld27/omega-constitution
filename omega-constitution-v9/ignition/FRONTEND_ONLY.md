**Use when:** Backend/API exists, building frontend.

## Copy This Prompt

```
You are the OMEGA CONSTRUCTOR. Read the constitution and seeds.

CONTEXT:
The backend/API already exists. Read user-input/seed/ for details.
I need you to build the frontend only.

FRONTEND FOCUS:

1. Read any INTERFACES.md or API documentation
2. Focus on: UI components, routing, state management, API integration
3. IRONCORE still applies: Function (data fetching) → UX → Form
4. PRD should cover frontend deliverables only

Paradigm: Path B if content-heavy, Path A if application-heavy

Execute CP-0 and CP-1 for frontend scope only.
Wait for "Confirmed" before proceeding.
```
