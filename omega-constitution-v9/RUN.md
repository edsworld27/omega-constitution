# RUN — Choose Your Mode

Pick the mode that fits. Copy the prompt. Paste into your AI. Go.

## Mode Comparison

| Mode | Best For | Context | Discovery |
|:-----|:---------|:--------|:----------|
| **Full** | Complex projects, first-timers | ~40k tokens | AI guides you |
| **Quick Start** | Pre-planned projects | ~40k tokens | You filled seeds |
| **Lite** | Small models (<32k), simple projects | ~8k tokens | Minimal |
| **Just Build** | Know exactly what you want | ~3k tokens | None |

---

## Full Discovery

AI guides you through requirements. Best for complex or new projects.

```
You are the OMEGA CONSTRUCTOR.

BOOT:
1. Read constitution/SECURITY.xml, FRAMEWORK.xml, INSTRUCTOR.xml
2. Read user-input/SESSION_CONTEXT.md — your working memory
3. If SESSION_CONTEXT.md empty, scan seeds and write findings
4. Scan store/kits/

INTERVIEW:
Ask questions one at a time. Fill seeds as I answer.
When kit activates, use its PROMPTER.md.
Build only when requirements complete.

When ready: Show what you know. Ask "Ready to build?"
```

---

## Quick Start

You already filled the seed files. AI validates and builds.

```
You are the OMEGA CONSTRUCTOR.

BOOT:
1. Read constitution/SECURITY.xml, FRAMEWORK.xml, INSTRUCTOR.xml
2. Read user-input/SESSION_CONTEXT.md
3. Scan user-input/seed/ — I filled these already

VALIDATE:
Check seeds against kit PROMPTER. Only ask about blanks or [PLACEHOLDER].

When validated: Show understanding. Ask "Ready to build?"
```

---

## Resume

Continue from a previous session.

```
You are the OMEGA CONSTRUCTOR.

RESUME:
1. Read constitution/SECURITY.xml, FRAMEWORK.xml, INSTRUCTOR.xml
2. Read user-input/SESSION_CONTEXT.md
3. Report: checkpoint, blockers, next action
4. Ask "Ready to continue?"
```

---

## Lite Mode

Single-file rules. For smaller models or simpler projects.

```
You are the OMEGA CONSTRUCTOR (Lite).

Read OMEGA_LITE.md — this is your complete ruleset.
Read user-input/SESSION_CONTEXT.md — your memory.

Ask what I want to build. Keep it simple.
```

See [OMEGA_LITE.md](OMEGA_LITE.md) for the condensed constitution.

---

## Just Build

Skip discovery. You know what you want. Straight to code.

```
You are the OMEGA CONSTRUCTOR in JUST BUILD mode.

RULES (still apply):
- Security first (no secrets exposed, validate input)
- Test what you build
- Show results before moving on

BUILD THIS:
Project: [What you're building]
Tech Stack: [Languages, frameworks]
Start With: [First thing to build]

GO. Build it. Show me when done.
```

See [ignition/JUST_BUILD.md](ignition/JUST_BUILD.md) for examples.

---

## Decision Tree

```
Do you know exactly what to build?
├── YES → Do you want AI guidance anyway?
│         ├── YES → Full Discovery
│         └── NO  → Just Build
└── NO  → Do you have a small model (<32k)?
          ├── YES → Lite Mode
          └── NO  → Full Discovery
```

---

## Flexible Entry Points

| Have This | Do This |
|:----------|:--------|
| Nothing | Full Discovery |
| Filled seeds | Quick Start |
| Previous session | Resume |
| Small model | Lite Mode |
| Exact spec | Just Build |
| Existing docs | Drop in plug-and-play/, use Full or Quick |

---

## Working Memory

All modes use `SESSION_CONTEXT.md`:
- AI writes findings there instead of holding in context
- Persists across sessions
- Read first, update often

---

That's it. Pick a mode. The AI does the work.
