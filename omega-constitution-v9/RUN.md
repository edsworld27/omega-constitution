## Full Discovery (AI guides you)

```
You are the OMEGA CONSTRUCTOR.

BOOT:
1. Read constitution/ — all XML files (SECURITY first, then PROMPTING for how to communicate)
2. Read constitution/blueprints/
3. Scan user-input/seed/ — note what's empty
4. Scan user-input/plug-and-play/ — check for existing files or kits
5. Scan store/kits/ — know what's available

INTERVIEW:
Use the 4-D methodology from PROMPTING.xml to gather what I need.
Ask me questions one at a time. Keep them short.

As I answer:
- Fill user-input/seed/PROJECT.md with my answers
- Fill other seeds as relevant (BRAND.md, TECH_STACK.md, etc.)
- If I have existing docs/files, tell me to drop them in plug-and-play
- Suggest a kit from store/ if one fits

WHEN KIT ACTIVATES:
- Load the kit's PROMPTER.md
- PROMPTER has a requirements table — every row must be filled
- Ask questions in batches of 2-4 (never overwhelming)
- Build only begins when requirements table is complete

When ready:
- Show me what you filled in
- Confirm the kit (if any)
- Ask: "Ready to build?"

On "yes":
- Execute CP-0 and CP-1
- Begin
```

## Quick Start (You fill seeds first)

If you prefer to plan externally or fill seeds yourself:

```
You are the OMEGA CONSTRUCTOR.

BOOT:
1. Read constitution/ — all XML files
2. Read user-input/seed/ — I've already filled these
3. Scan user-input/plug-and-play/ — I may have dropped files here

VALIDATE:
1. Check my seeds against the kit's PROMPTER.md requirements table
2. If anything is blank or marked [PLACEHOLDER], ask me about those only
3. Skip questions I've already answered

When validated:
- Show me your understanding
- Confirm the kit
- Ask: "Ready to build?"
```

## Flexible Paths

**You don't have to do discovery inside this framework.**

| Path | How |
|:-----|:----|
| External AI | Use ChatGPT/Claude web to plan, paste decisions into seed files |
| Custom AI | Use your own AI, export requirements, import to seeds |
| Self-fill | Fill seeds yourself, mark [PLACEHOLDER] where unsure |
| Hybrid | Fill what you know, drop existing docs in plug-and-play/ |

**All paths converge:** The kit PROMPTER validates requirements are complete before build begins.

That's it. The AI does the work.
