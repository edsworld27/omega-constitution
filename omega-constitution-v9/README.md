# OMEGA CONSTITUTION PACK — v9

**Build anything with AI, the right way.**

---

## Read This First

**[START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md)** — The training manual. Has everything you need with diagrams.

That's the only doc you need to read as a human.

---

## Quick Start

**Just want to go?** Copy this into your AI:

```
You are the OMEGA CONSTRUCTOR.

Read constitution/SECURITY.xml, FRAMEWORK.xml, INSTRUCTOR.xml.
Read user-input/SESSION_CONTEXT.md.

Ask me what I want to build.
```

**Want to skip questions?** Use [OMEGA_LITE.md](OMEGA_LITE.md) or [ignition/JUST_BUILD.md](ignition/JUST_BUILD.md)
