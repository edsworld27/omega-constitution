# CONTEXT — THE ROOT SEED

**Purpose:** Everything grows from this file. This is the single source of truth for what your project IS. Fill this in and the system adapts to your project.

**If you leave sections blank:** The agent will ask you about them at CP-1 using structured questions. You don't have to know everything upfront — but the more you fill in, the faster you get to building.

---

## 1. Project Name
(What is this project called?)

## 2. Project Type
Select one — this determines what other seed files are required:
- [ ] **Web Application** (SaaS, Dashboard, Portal) → Requires: TECH_STACK.md
- [ ] **Website** (Marketing, Blog, E-commerce) → Requires: BRAND.md
- [ ] **Agentic Workflow** (AI Agents, Multi-Agent) → Requires: TECH_STACK.md, AGENTS.md
- [ ] **Automation** (n8n, Make, Zapier, Custom) → Requires: TECH_STACK.md
- [ ] **Mobile App** (iOS, Android, Cross-platform) → Requires: TECH_STACK.md, BRAND.md
- [ ] **API / Backend Service** → Requires: TECH_STACK.md
- [ ] **Other:** (describe)

## 3. The North Star
(One sentence: What is the singular outcome this project must achieve?)

## 4. Who Is This For?
(Describe the end user. Be specific — not "everyone".)

## 5. What Problem Does It Solve?
(In plain English.)

## 6. Non-Goals
(What will this project explicitly NOT do? List at least 3.)
1.
2.
3.

## 7. Core Constraints
- **Budget:** (e.g., £0 / £500 / £5,000)
- **Timeline:** (e.g., 2 weeks / 3 months)
- **Tech Stack:** (e.g., Next.js + Supabase / see TECH_STACK.md / No preference)
- **Compliance:** (e.g., GDPR / HIPAA / None)
- **Hosting:** (e.g., Vercel / VPS / Self-hosted / No preference)

## 8. Existing Assets
(List anything that already exists: designs, databases, APIs, content, brand guidelines, etc.)

## 9. Key Decisions Already Made
(Anything locked in that the agent should NOT question.)

## 10. Open Questions
(Things you haven't decided yet — the agent may ask about these.)

## 11. Active Seed Files
Check which additional seed files you've filled in:
- [ ] `BRAND.md` — Brand identity
- [ ] `TECH_STACK.md` — Technology decisions
- [ ] `KNOWLEDGE.md` — Domain knowledge base
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` — Agent definitions (agentic projects only)
- [ ] `PERSONAS.md` — User personas
- [ ] `COMPETITORS.md` — Market analysis
- [ ] `CONTENT.md` — Content strategy (websites)
- [ ] `CONSTRAINTS.md` — Hard limits (budget, timeline, performance)
- [ ] `METRICS.md` — Success KPIs
