# START HERE

**Omega Constitution Pack v9** — Build anything with AI, the right way.

---

## Two Ways to Start

### Option 1: Let AI Guide You (Recommended)

1. Open this folder in your AI tool
2. Copy the prompt from [RUN.md](RUN.md)
3. Paste and talk

The AI interviews you, fills your seeds, suggests kits, and builds. You just answer questions.

### Option 2: Fill It Yourself

If you prefer to set things up manually:

1. Fill `user-input/seed/PROJECT.md` (and other seeds you want)
2. Pick a kit from `store/kits/` → copy to `user-input/plug-and-play/kits/`
3. Pick a prompt from `ignition/` (FRESH_BUILD, IMPORT_PROJECT, etc.)
4. Paste into AI and go

## Have Existing Work?

Either way:
- Drop files into `user-input/plug-and-play/`
- Or tell the AI: "My files are at /path"

The AI will detect them and ask what to do.
