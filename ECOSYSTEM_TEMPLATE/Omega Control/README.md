# 🔒 The Omega DEV Panel
**Confidentiality:** MAXIMUM  
**Role:** Master Architect Workspace

Welcome to the **Omega DEV Panel**. This repository (`edsworld27/omega-dev`) is the private, untracked command center for architecting, evaluating, and mutating the global Omega Ecosystem. 

Unlike the public `Omega-System` execution shell, which is deliberately sterile and lightweight, this Dev Panel acts as the "God-Mode" sandbox.

## 🏗️ The 5-Repo Ecosystem
As of V15, the monolithic architecture has been violently decoupled. You are the Architect of 5 independent repositories.

1. 🧠 **[omega-constitution](https://github.com/edsworld27/omega-constitution):** The public "Brain" (XML rules, protocols, B.L.A.S.T pipeline).
2. 🛒 **[omega-store](https://github.com/edsworld27/omega-store):** The public "Marketplace" (SaaS Kits, Website templates, Python Skills).
3. 🦀 **[omega-claw](https://github.com/edsworld27/omega-claw):** The public "Dispatch" (Watchdogs, Compressors, Automation scripts).
4. ⚡ **[Omega-System]((https://github.com/edsworld27/Omega-System)):** The public "Execution Shell" (The ultra-lightweight environment users download on Day 1).
5. 🔒 **omega-dev (You are here):** The private meta-development workspace holding the master perspective over everything.

## 📂 Dev Directory Structure

The Dev Panel mirrors the strict numerical formatting native to the Constitution, providing a dedicated space for meta-development out of the public eye.

*   `00_Changelog/` — The brutal historical ledger of all structural modifications.
*   `01_Evaluations/` — McKinsey-grade SWOT analyses and vulnerability audits of the overarching system.
*   `02_Testing/` — Private integration test logs (e.g., verifying `watchdog.py` actually catches E4 hallucination loops).
*   `03_Context/` — Session continuity files (`CONTEXT_DEV.md`) for dropping an AI instantly into the "state" of your active meta-project.
*   `04_Implementations/` — High-level tactical roadmaps (like the V15 5-Repo Decoupling plan).
*   `05_Ideation/` — Scratchpads and visionary drafts before they become formal PRDs.
*   **🚨 `06_Full_System/`** — **THE MASTER SANDBOX.** This nested folder contains hot clones of ALL 4 public repositories natively integrated, giving your AI agent the ability to execute cross-repo mutations perfectly.

## 🔄 The "God-Mode" CI/CD Loop

When you want to fundamentally alter how the public AI system works:

1. **Ideate:** Write your concept in `05_Ideation/`.
2. **Execute:** Instruct your AI (Claude/Cursor) to execute the idea directly into the tracked repos sitting inside `06_Full_System/`.
3. **Deploy:** Manually `cd` into the respective sub-repositories (`06_Full_System/omega-constitution`, etc.) and push the individual updates to their remotes on GitHub. 
4. **Live Update:** Because public shell users (`Omega-System`) dynamically fetch protocols from the cloud via MCP or curl on Day 1, your deployed changes go instantly live across the entire global user base in zero seconds, with no package downloads required.
