# Changelog: V16.31 (Kit Creation Architecture)

## Overview
Based on user feedback, the loose instructional files floating within the `omega-store/kits/` directory were disorganized. We have consolidated them to improve discoverability.

## Core Advancements

### 1. The "Make a Kit" Directory
- **Consolidation:** Created `06_Full_System/omega-store/kits/make_a_kit/`.
- **Relocation:** Moved `KIT_CREATION_GUIDE.md`, `KIT_EXPORT_GUIDE.md`, and `KIT_GUIDE.md` into this dedicated directory. 
- **Result:** The `kits/` root directory is now physically clean, containing *only* actual executable Kits and this single instructional repository.

### 2. Structural Mapping
- **Omega Store Treemap Updated:** Rewritten to clearly map the `make_a_kit/` directory and its 3 instructional sub-files. Users and AI agents now have a clear path to follow when designing and exporting new Omega ecosystem capabilities.

Ecosystem paths updated and synced.
