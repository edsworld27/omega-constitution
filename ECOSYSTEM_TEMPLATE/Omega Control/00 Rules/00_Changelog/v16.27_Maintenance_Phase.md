# Changelog: V16.27 (Post-Launch Maintenance & Integrations Phase)

## Overview
This sprint answers the reality of agency work: projects never truly end at publication. We formalized "Maintenance Mode," a dedicated Phase 05 for the Website Kit designed to handle returning clients asking for text edits, new blogs, or new plugin integrations.

## Core Advancements

### 1. Phase 05: Maintenance
- **Created `01_BLOG_OR_EDIT.task.md`:** This entirely new protocol dictates how the AI re-opens a completed project.
- **The CMS-First Mandate:** To preserve the purity of the frontend code, the AI is now commanded to audit and edit the `project/database/cms/` Hot Swap file *first* when a client asks for text, color, or image changes. Hacking the raw React/HTML simply to change a paragraph is strictly forbidden.
- **Plugin Localization:** Directed the AI to place all new third-party scripts (Stripe, Calendly) inside the newly formed `project/database/plugins/` directory.

### 2. Discovery & Navigation Evolution
- **Updated `PROMPTER.md`:** Added upfront discovery questions regarding third-party Integrations and Plugins, ensuring the database structure has utility from the very first prompt.
- **Mode Expansion:** Formally defined "Maintenance Mode" in the Prompter's execution paths, giving the AI a clear behavioral stance when handling returning clients.
- **Treemap Expansion:** Updated the nested Website Kit `TREEMAP.md` to reflect the complete 5-phase lifecycle.
