# Changelog: V16.23 to V16.25 (The Omni-Router & Speedrun Evolution)

## Overview
This sprint focused on exponential deployment speed and dynamic architectural routing. We transitioned the Omega ecosystem from a static generator to a dynamic architect capable of outsourcing to external AI UI builders, instantly swapping brands via a central CMS, and heavily strictly enforcing local SEO (NAPO).

## Core Advancements

### 1. The Omni-Router & Modular Architecture (V16.23)
- **Tech Stack Discovery:** The Prompter now determines CMS, CRM webhook, and framework logic up front.
- **Landing Page Dictionary:** Created `LANDING_PAGE_SECTIONS.md` for modular component selection (Heroes, Bento Boxes) prior to coding.
- **AI Builder Routing:** Mapped out the delegation process to `v0/Lovable`. The AI generates the prompt, the user pastes it into the GUI tool, and the AI acts as "The Hammer," auditing the returned code against Mobile-First and Container laws upon ingestion.

### 2. Project CMS & Tracking Schema (V16.24)
- **Hot Swap CMS File:** Formalized `01_GLOBAL_VARIABLES_CMS.task.md`. The AI must generate a central `site.config` file storing all brand data (colors, fonts, copy). Individual UI components pull from this config dynamically. No hardcoding allowed.
- **Head & Schema Hub:** Formalized `02.5_TRACKING_AND_SCHEMA.task.md`. Standardized Meta Pixel, GTM, and JSON-LD schema injections. Schema must dynamically feed off the Hot Swap CMS file.

### 3. NAPO & Nested Treemaps (V16.25)
- **NAPO Consistency:** Mandated Name, Address, Phone, and Operating Hours as core variables in the Hot Swap CMS, and explicitly required them in Schema generation to supercharge Local SEO.
- **Map Links:** Required precise footer link mapping to Google Maps / Apple Connect.
- **Nested Kit Treemaps:** Created a localized `TREEMAP.md` inside the Website Kit to give the AI a high-resolution, modular map of the Kit's 4-Phase lifecycle. Updated the Store Master Treemap to link to this nested layer.
