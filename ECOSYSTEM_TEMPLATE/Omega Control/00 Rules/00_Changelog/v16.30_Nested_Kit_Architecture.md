# Changelog: V16.30 (Nested Kit Architecture)

## Overview
Based on user feedback, we formalized the physical reality of the Meta-Kit concept. If building a website is part of a Marketing Agency's service offering, the kit hierarchy must reflect this physically, not just theoretically.

## Core Advancements

### 1. The Marketing Agency Meta-Kit
- **Physical Nesting:** Moved the `website/` kit entirely inside `marketing_agency/`. 
- **The Result:** The path for the core web builder is now `06_Full_System/omega-store/kits/marketing_agency/website/`. This proves the concept of nesting specialized capabilities under overarching business models.
- **Routing:** A user can now ask the AI for a "Marketing Agency execution," and the AI will logically descend into the nested Website kit to build the foundation before applying higher-level agency marketing layers (Maps, Apple Connect, SEO).

### 2. Structural Mapping
- **Omega Store Treemap Updated:** Rewritten to clearly map the umbrella of `marketing_agency/` housing its sub-kits.
- **Meta-Kit Treemap Created:** Formally mapped the internal structure of the `marketing_agency/` directory.

Ecosystem paths updated and synced.
