# Changelog: V16.26 (Project Database & Standalone Architecture)

## Overview
This sprint focused on absolute deployment purity. We ensured that while the Omega AI leverages the massive Dev Panel to generate the project, the output itself (`project/`) remains mathematically pure and 100% standalone, ready for instant hosting without tying back to dev-environment dependencies.

## Core Advancements

### 1. The Project Database Mandate
- **Sterile Boundary Refinement:** Updated `WEBSITE_KIT.md` to force all initialized projects to scaffold a `database/` directory at their root.
- **Asset Isolation:** 
  - `database/cms/`: Houses the Hot Swap `site.config.ts`.
  - `database/fonts/`: Houses localized WOFF2 files (banning external Google Font API calls for PageSpeed).
  - `database/plugins/`: Houses localized scripts.
- **Deployment Purity:** Because all brand logic and assets live entirely within `project/database/`, the User can deploy the `project/` folder straight to Vercel/Netlify instantly, without needing the Omega Constitution ecosystem attached.

## Brain Upgrades
- `v8.2`: Standalone Architect Brain
