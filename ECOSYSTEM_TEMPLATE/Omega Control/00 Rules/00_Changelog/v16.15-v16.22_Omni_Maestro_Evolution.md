# Changelog: V16.15 to V16.22 (The Omni-Maestro & Meta-Kit Evolution)

## Overview
This sequence of updates represents a massive leap in the ecosystem's capabilities, transitioning from generic website generation to professional, agency-level digital architecture. We introduced "Maestro Modes" for flexible fulfillment, "Meta-Kits" for layered agency tools, the "Audit-Repair Loop" for automated perfection, and the ultimate "Guardian Gate" for security.

## Core Advancements

### 1. Kit Evolution & Maestro Modes (V16.15 - V16.18)
- **Aesthetic Layer (AESTHETIC_LAYER.xml):** Grounded professional design principles (WCAG AAA contrast, micro-animations, glassmorphism) into the Website Kit.
- **Kit Lifecycles:** Formalized the 4-phase sequence: Pre-production, Production, Verification, Publication.
- **Architect's Sequence:** Pre-production tasks were completely rewritten to match the Architect's workflow (Market Audit -> SEO Intent -> UX Journey -> Copy Structure).
- **Maestro Modes:** Allowed users to "Skip to Design" while maintaining strict architectural checkpoints (`TREEMAP.md`, `CP_STRUCTURE.md`) and mobile-first container laws.

### 2. Agency Meta-Kits & Perfection Loops (V16.19 - V16.20)
- **Marketing Agency Meta-Kit:** Created a new class of kit that "stacks" on top of the Website Kit, handling agency-level fulfillment like Google Maps and Apple Business Connect.
- **Audit-Repair Loop:** Mandated that the AI ingest Lighthouse and SEO Optimer errors, repair the code, and re-audit until perfection is achieved.
- **The Guardian Gate:** Introduced `02_SECURITY_AUDIT.task.md` and mandated a final constitutional security pass (`SECURITY.xml`) before any project can be marked "COMPLETE".

### 3. Store Master Treemap (V16.21)
- Created the **Store Master Treemap** (`omega-store/TREEMAP.md`), serving as the "Super Contents Map" for the ecosystem.
- Integrated the **Navigator Protocol** into the Brain, ensuring the AI reads this map instantly during Technical Discovery to grab the latest Kits and Skills.

### 4. Self-Governing Dev Mode (V16.22)
- Created **`RUN_DEV_MODE.xml`** to formalize the AI's internal development process (SWOT loops, sharding, context updates).
