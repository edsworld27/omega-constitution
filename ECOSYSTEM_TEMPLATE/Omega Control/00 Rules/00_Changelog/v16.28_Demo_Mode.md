# Changelog: V16.28 (Demo Mode & Pure Frontend Execution)

## Overview
This sprint introduces "Demo Mode" to the Omega Ecosystem. We recognized that not every project requires a heavy V16.26 database architecture or deep SEO Schema on day one. Demo Mode provides a lightweight, pure-frontend pathway for rapid visual prototyping and client approvals.

## Core Advancements

### 1. Pure Frontend Boundaries
- **Updated `PROMPTER.md`**: Introduced "Demo Mode (UI Showcase)" as an official execution path. 
- **Updated `WEBSITE_KIT.md`**: Formalized the boundaries of Demo Mode. When active, the AI is constitutionally bound to skip heavy backend analysis (`02_SEO_INTENT`, Tracking, Schema). It will *only* generate the Aesthetic Layer (into `project/database/cms/`) and instantly scaffold the pure React/HTML/CSS components.
- **The Result**: The Architect can now build a highly-polished, Mobile-First UI at lightning speed strictly for "show and tell", reserving the complex production lifecycles for when the client formally approves the layout.
