# CONTEXT_DEV — Constitution Development Context

**Purpose:** Working memory for developing the Omega Constitution itself. Meta-level: using the framework to build the framework.

---

## Current State

**Version:** v16.7 (Fractal Fulfillment)
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Infinite Fractal Sharding Enabled (Dev-Only)

---

## Recent Session Summary

### Session: 2026-02-28
**What we did:**
- Implemented "The Rule of 3" (Fractal Sharding) recursively across all dev directories.
- Introduced "Tree Map Spawning" for localized high-speed navigation.
- Established the "Scaffolding vs. Product" boundary (V16.7).
- Initialized the Eternal `MASTER_PRD.md` as the evolving source of truth.
- Sharded `00_Changelog`, `01_Evaluations`, `04_Implementations`, and `05_Ideation`.

**Architecture decisions:**
- dev-work/ = Fractal Scaffolding (Infinite scalability).
- project/ = Sterile Product (Clean handoff).
- Every 3 items = New Shard Subdirectory.
- Every folder = Local TREE_MAP.md Index.

## Active Priorities

1. [x] V16.6/V16.7 Fractal Sharding Deployment.
2. [ ] Phase 3: Hive Orchestration & Autonomous Loops.
3. [ ] Finalize "Clean Project" handoff validation suite.

## Known Issues / Debt

| Issue | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| future-kits need completion | Low | saas, api, automation in DEV/future-kits/ |
| Python scripts need testing | Medium | omega_compiler.py, auto_security.py |

---

## Vision

Make Omega fully open-source and AI-tool agnostic:
- Cursor, VS Code, Antigravity can all understand it
- AI can turn projects into reusable kits
- Community can contribute kits to omega-store
