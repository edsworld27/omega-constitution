# 🧠 OMEGA DEV PANEL — "GOD-MODE" ENFORCEMENT RULES
**Security Level:** SYSTEM ROOT  
**Target:** ALL AUTONOMOUS AGENTS, LLMS, AND COPILOTS (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Antigravity, etc.)

**🔴 INITIAL ACTION: ALIGN, DESIGN & TALK (IDE RULES v1.0)**
Before you begin any technical work:
1. **LOCATE** `00_Constitution` (The Brain) and read `INSTRUCTOR.xml`.
2. **DESIGN & ALIGN:** Use the **CP-STRUCTURE** protocol. Propose a custom dev blueprint in `DEV_MAP.md` based on discovery. Align the workbench to the **Fallback Core (00-05)** or your custom architecture expansion.
3. **REFERENCE:** Treat these Master Rules as your primary **IDE RULES** for this environment.
4. **STOP.** Immediately respond to the user to confirm the project direction and custom architecture.

## 🚨 PRIME DIRECTIVE: THE TRACKING OVERRIDE

You are currently operating inside the `Omega DEV Panel` (`edsworld27/omega-dev`). This is not a standard application repository. This is a private, meta-development Sandbox containing tracked clones of the entire 5-Repo Omega Ecosystem.

By default, AI Agents (like Antigravity or Cursor) attempt to write their internal "thoughts," "tasks," or "checklists" into hidden system folders (e.g., `~/.gemini/antigravity/brain/...` or `.cursor/`).

**🔴 INITIATION SEQUENCE: ONBOARDING & SETUP (OMEGA PROMPTER)**
Before you build anything, you MUST:
1. **INTERVIEW:** Use the **4-D Methodology** from `06_Full_System/omega-constitution/PROMPTING.xml` to extract high-resolution requirements.
2. **DIAGNOSE:** Audit the user's intent for gaps. No PRDs or phases until the requirements are crystalline.
3. **CP-STRUCTURE:** Propose the custom Dev Layout (04_Implementations/) before sharding or code generation.

**🔴 CRITICAL SYSTEM RULE: THE FALLBACK CORE (00-05)**
- **00_Constitution:** Supreme Rules & Brain. [LOCATE FIRST]
- **01_User_Input:** Seeds, PRDs, and Pilot intent. [SCAN SECOND]
- **02_Evaluations:** SWOTs, Audits, and Sharded History.
- **03_Context:** Session memory and Fractal Shards.
- **04_Implementations:** Phases, Tasks, and sharded plans.
- **05_Ideation:** Inbox, research, and future concepts.
- **ARCHITECTURE:** AI is AUTHORIZED to design and fulfill unique structures beyond 05 based on project complexity.

**🔴 CRITICAL DIRECTORY RULE: THE CLEAN HANDOFF**
- **PRODUCTION:** All application source code MUST be in `USER SPACE/project/`.
- **STERILITY:** `project/` must remain sterile (no metadata/checklists) for easy delivery.
- **DEVELOPMENT:** Use the Fallback Core (01-05+) or your custom Architecture for all scaffolding.

### 1. Mandatory Artifact Redirection
Whenever the user asks you to "Plan a feature," "Write a checklist," or "Draft an implementation," you **MUST** write that Markdown file directly into the tracked Dev Panel directory:

➡️ **`04_Implementations/`**

### 2. Formatting the Tracker
When creating a tracker file, name it explicitly based on the task (e.g., `v16.1_Feature_Addition_Tasks.md`). 

It must contain:
1. The objective summary.
2. The B.L.A.S.T pipeline (Blueprint, Link, Architect, Stylize, Trigger) or your native task-breakdown steps.
3. Checkboxes (`- [ ]`, `- [x]`) that you physically update within the repository as you complete steps.

### 3. Cross-Repo Action Status
When the user asks you to execute an action inside the `06_Full_System/` sandbox (e.g., "Update the template in `omega-store`"), you must:
1. Announce your plan in the `04_Implementations/` document.
2. Edit the target code within `06_Full_System/[target-repo]/`.
3. Check off the box in the `04_Implementations/` document.

*You exist to document your own engineering process for the human Architect. Hidden context is banned.*
