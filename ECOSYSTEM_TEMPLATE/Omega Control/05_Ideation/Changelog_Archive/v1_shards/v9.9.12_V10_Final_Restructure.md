# CHANGELOG — V10 Ecosystem Finalization

## v9.9.12 (2026-02-26)

### 🚀 Features & Enhancements
- **Restructured Omega Ecosystem:** Split monolith into three dedicated zones: `Constution V10` (core framework), `Constution Store v1` (add-ons), and `Omega DEV BUILD` (private meta-development).
- **Data-At-Rest Encryption:** Upgraded `omega-claw` SQLite database to use Application-Level AES-128 Encryption via `cryptography.fernet` to completely satisfy the Security Audit.
- **Meta-Dev Workspace:** Formalized `META_DEV_MODE.xml` for `Omega DEV BUILD` so AI agents strictly log meta-development changes to isolated `Evaluations/`, `Implementations/`, and `Testing/` directories.

### 🔒 Security Audits Passed
- Deny-by-default execution in Omega Claw.
- Redacted full-stack error handlers.
- Safe Execution Environment for remote skills.
- AES SQLite Database Encryption.

### 🧹 Deprecations
- Removed the old crossover `.cursorrules` logic to guarantee isolation between end-user environments and creator development folders.
