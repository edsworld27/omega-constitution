# OMEGA SYSTEM-WIDE EVALUATION (V16.29)

**Execution Date:** 2026-02-28
**Core Engine:** INSTRUCTOR.xml (v8.2)
**Ecosystem Status:** Fully Sharded, Standalone Purity, Production Ready.

## 1. Executive Summary
The Omega Monolith has been successfully shattered and rebuilt into a 5-Repository decentralized ecosystem. This architecture ensures that core instructions, execution templates, tooling, and development environments are completely isolated. 

## 2. Repository Audits & Purity Verification

### 📁 REPO 1: `omega-constitution`
*The Core Brain & Ruleset*
**Status:** Pure.
- Contains only `.xml` directives (`INSTRUCTOR.xml`, `SECURITY.xml`, `PROMPTING.xml`).
- **V16.29 State:** Brain upgraded to v8.2 ("Standalone Architect"). Holds the supreme laws like the "CMS-First Mandate" and "Project Database Purity."

### 📁 REPO 2: `omega-store`
*The Execution Kits & Tooling*
**Status:** Pure.
- Houses the `kits/` directory (Website, Marketing Agency).
- **V16.29 State:** Website kit features a fully realized 5-Phase lifecycle (Pre-production, Production, Verification, Publication, Maintenance), with 4 distinct running modes (Architect, Maestro, Demo, Maintenance). Nested Treemaps deployed.

### 📁 REPO 3: `omega-claw`
*The External Crawlers & API Connections*
**Status:** Stable (Foundational).
- Isolated repository for future web-scraping, deep-sea research, and automated auditing scripts. Currently separated from core intelligence to prevent scope creep.

### 📁 REPO 4: `Omega-System`
*The User Environment (Public Facing)*
**Status:** Pure.
- The "Zero-Install Shell." This is what the end-user actually downloads.
- Contains only the `omega-index.md` bootloader and a pristine `user_workspace/` directory.
- **V16.29 State:** Constitutionally bound via `.cursorrules` to dynamically fetch intelligence from the `omega-constitution` repository without hosting it locally.

### 📁 REPO 5: `Omega DEV Panel`
*The Architect's Sandbox (Master Control)*
**Status:** Pure.
- This is the singular source of truth for all Omega development. 
- Organizes iterations logically: `00_Changelog`, `01_User_Input`, `02_Evaluations`, `03_Context`, `06_Full_System`.
- **V16.29 State:** Houses the `omega-publish.py` "God-Mode" script, which takes the local `06_Full_System` master files and forcefully synchronizes the four public repositories above.

## 3. Final Verdict
The Omega Ecosystem is mathematically aligned. The separation of concerns between Intelligence (Constitution), Capabilities (Store), Output (System), and Development (Dev Panel) is absolute. The AI is now capable of full end-to-end agency fulfillment with zero Dev Panel bleed into the final client product.

Ready for Live Fire Testing.
