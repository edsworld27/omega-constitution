# PRD: Omega Nexus Landing Page (Master UI v3)

## 1. Context: The Omega Evolution
The Omega System is a tri-fold AGI architecture (Constitution, Store, Jarvis) designed for hardened, local autonomy. As we evolve, the system requires a consumer-grade, "WOW" factor entry point—a digital storefront for the Pilot that reflects the absolute power and security of the underlying engine.

## 2. Objective
To create a minimalist, high-fidelity landing page that serves as the primary gateway to the Mission Control. It must visually communicate the "Premium AGI" aesthetic while providing secure access through the 5-point MFA vault.

## 3. Core Features - Phase 1: The Gateway

### 3.1 The "Omegafied" Hero Section
- **Visuals**: Dark-mode aesthetic (#050505) with Electric Blue highlights. High-contrast typography and subtle "spring" animations from the Website Kit.
- **Messaging**: "THE OMEGA NEXUS" — Defining the local AGI evolution.
- **Call-to-Action**: A central "IGNITE MISSION CONTROL" button that triggers the security handshake.

### 3.2 Integrated Repository Suite
- **Purpose**: To provide the Pilot with immediate access to the ecosystem's source code.
- **Link Alpha**: Direct connection to the **Omega System** (Master Repository).
- **Link Omega**: Direct connection to the **Omega Claw** (AGI Engine).
- **Terminal Logic**: An embedded "command line" component for rapid installation via `git clone`.

### 3.3 The Security Vault Transition
- **UX**: A seamless transition from the landing page into a dedicated "Security Chamber" for Pilot verification.
- **Technical**: Leverages the 5-point MFA logic (Email, Hardware, Neural) built into the Next.js framework.

## 4. Design Mandates (Website Kit v3)
- **Spring Animations**: Use `cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.275)` for all transitions.
- **Hover Transitions**: Implement "Hover-Lift" on all cards and interactive elements.
- **Typography**: Bold, high-contrast sans-serif tracking for a premium technical feel.
