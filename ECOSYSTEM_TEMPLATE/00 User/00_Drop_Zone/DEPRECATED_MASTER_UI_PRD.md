# PRD: Omega Master UI & Software Framework Nexus

## 1. Objective
To create a "God-Mode" entry point for the Omega System that bridges the gap between a public-facing premium landing page and a high-security local AGI dashboard. This system must utilize the "Omega Website Kit" and "Aesthetic Layer" tokens for visual excellence.

## 2. User Personas
- **The Pilot (You)**: The sole administrator and user. Requires absolute security, high-velocity task management, and a "WOW" factor UI.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Premium Landing Page ("The Front Gate")
- **Hero Section**: High-impact "Omegafied" design with spring-loaded typography.
- **Login CTA**: Initiates the 5-Point MFA Vault handshake.
- **Download Suite**: 
    - Omega System Repo (Master)
    - Omega Claw Engine (Sub-module)
    - Quick-Install Terminal Snippet.

### 3.2 The Security Chamber (MFA Vault)
- **Multi-Stage Verification**: 
    - 3x Email Sequence Tokens.
    - 1x Hardware/SMS Link.
    - 1x Neural Handshake (Security Question).
- **UX**: Staggered fade-in elements and clear "Layer" indicators.

### 3.3 Jarvis Mission Control (Dashboard v3)
- **Operations Board**: Premium Kanban with Website Kit tokens.
- **Pattern Memory interface**: Visual lab for agent learning.
- **Hive & Permanent Swarm**: Real-time monitoring of all agent types.
- **System Collation**: One-click "Ignite" and "Global Sync" capabilities.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router).
- **Styles**: Tailwind CSS + Custom Omega Tokens (Aesthetic Layer).
- **Backend Bridge**: Python FastAPI (Localhost).
- **Security**: Local-only hardened access.

## 5. Success Metrics
- **Visual Fidelity**: "WOW" grade aesthetics (90+ score).
- **Security**: 0 bypasses on the 5-Point MFA.
- **Sync**: 100% mathematical alignment across the Tri-Fold architecture.
