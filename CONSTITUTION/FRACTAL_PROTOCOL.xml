    <directive name="The Rule of 3 (Fractal Sharding)">
        <rule>FILE SHARDING: Every directory MUST shard its contents after 3 files into a versioned subdirectory (e.g., `v1_files/`).</rule>
        <rule>FOLDER SHARDING: Every parent directory MUST shard its subdirectories after 3 folders into a versioned meta-folder (e.g., `cluster_v1/`).</rule>
        <rule>RECURSION: This rule is recursive, creating an infinite fractal tree of organized project memory.</rule>
    </directive>
    <directive name="Tree Map Spawning">
        <rule>Every directory in the fractal tree MUST contain a local `TREE_MAP.md` or `INDEX.md` at its root.</rule>
        <rule>The Tree Map MUST be spawned immediately upon the creation of the first shard or meta-folder.</rule>
        <rule>The Tree Map MUST link to all children (files or sub-shards) and provide a 1-sentence summary of their contents to enable high-speed AI navigation.</rule>
    </directive>
    <directive name="Scope of Application & Boundaries">
        <rule>DEV-ONLY MANDATE: Fractal Sharding and Tree Map Spawning apply STRICTLY to the `dev-work/` directory and its sub-branches.</rule>
        <rule>PROJECT STERILITY: The `project/` directory MUST remain un-sharded and free of AI scaffolding (TreeView maps, versioned clusters, etc.) unless explicitly requested for massive codebases.</rule>
        <rule>USER HANDOFF: The `project/` directory is the final product. It must follow standard industry naming and folder conventions for professional handoff.</rule>
