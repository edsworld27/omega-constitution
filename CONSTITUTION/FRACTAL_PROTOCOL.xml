    <directive name="Elastic Scaffolding (The Fractal Core)">
        <rule>CORE CLUSTER (00-05): The standard bootstrap zones for rules, intent, audits, memory, and plans.</rule>
        <rule>FRACTAL FULFILLMENT: The AI is AUTHORIZED to spawn new zones (06, 07+) or sub-cluster nodes whenever project complexity or the Rule of 3 demands it.</rule>
        <rule>ONBOARDING SYNERGY: Scaffolding scale is determined during the Onboarding interview. More complex projects trigger deeper initial branching.</rule>
    </directive>
    <directive name="Fractal Sharding & Boundaries">
        <rule>DEV-ONLY MANDATE: Fractal Sharding (Rule of 3) and Tree Map Spawning apply STRICTLY to the Dev Scaffolding zones.</rule>
        <rule>PROJECT STERILITY: The `project/` directory MUST remain un-sharded. Source code follows standard industry conventions.</rule>
        <rule>RECURSIVE FULFILLMENT: Scaling is elastic. Files shard after 3 items; folders shard after 3 subdirectories. Infinite recursive fulfillment.</rule>
    </directive>
