    <principle name="Modularity & DRY">
        <directive>Always architecture code into small, specialized modules. Never repeat logic across components.</directive>
        <standard>Use functional components in React and class-based services in Python/Node.js where appropriate.</standard>
    </principle>
    <principle name="Security First">
        <directive>Sanitize all user inputs and enforce least-privilege for API keys and database connections.</directive>
        <standard>Never hardcode secrets. Use environment variables defined in `.env.example` templates.</standard>
    </principle>
    <principle name="Type Safety & Clarity">
        <directive>Strict typing is mandatory. Code must be self-documenting for both humans and AI agents.</directive>
        <standard>Use TypeScript for web apps and PEP 484 type hints for Python. Every function must have a clear docstring.</standard>
    </principle>
    <principle name="Performance & Lighthouse">
        <directive>Target 100/100 Lighthouse scores. Optimize for perceived performance and Core Web Vitals.</directive>
        <standard>Minimize main-thread work. Use lazy-loading, image compression, and efficient data structures by default.</standard>
    </principle>
    <principle name="Error Management">
        <directive>Implement robust, graceful failovers. An application must never crash without a user-friendly error state.</directive>
        <standard>Use Try/Catch blocks in JS and Try/Except in Python. Log errors to a central location for auditing.</standard>
    </principle>
    <principle name="AI-Readability">
        <directive>Code must be optimized for multi-agent collaboration. Maintain a consistent, predictable structure.</directive>
        <standard>Follow the `STRUCTURE.xml` conventions strictly. Use clear, descriptive variable names that reflect intent.</standard>
